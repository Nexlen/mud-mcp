### Implementation Updates (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Updated `types/index.ts` with new Tool and Prompt interfaces aligned to MCP 2025-03-26
- ✅ Completely rebuilt `toolsService.ts` with proper tool/handler separation and new schema support
- ✅ Updated `promptsService.ts` to use new arguments-based Prompt interface
- ✅ Enhanced `stateService.ts` with missing helper methods
- ✅ Fixed all compilation errors in `mcp/server.ts` and integrated new service interfaces
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ **Implemented dynamic tool availability** - tools now appear/disappear based on game state
- ✅ **Added battle system** - players can fight monsters when present in rooms
- ✅ **Fixed item system** - added missing torch, key, potion, and gold item definitions
- ✅ **Enhanced state management** - proper TOOLS_CHANGED events emitted when game state changes
- ✅ **File cleanup** - removed duplicate `promptsService_new.ts` file

### Dynamic Tool System Features
- ✅ Tools are contextual based on current room state
- ✅ `take` tool only available when items are present in room
- ✅ `battle` tool only available when monsters are present in room  
- ✅ `move` tool only available when room has exits
- ✅ `look` and `inventory` tools always available
- ✅ TOOLS_CHANGED events emitted when:
  - Player moves between rooms
  - Items are taken from rooms
  - Monsters are defeated
  - Game state changes affect available actions

## Current Issues

1. ~~TypeScript build errors~~ (FIXED)
2. ~~Transport message handling~~ (FIXED)
3. ~~Specification alignment~~ (FIXED - Updated to 2025-03-26)
4. Need to update implementation to match new specification requirements
5. Need proper error recovery for failed requests
6. Need proper session cleanup on disconnects

## Technical Debt

1. **Specification Compliance**:
   - Update tool definitions to include `inputSchema` and `annotations`
   - Enhance prompt system with proper argument handling
   - Implement resource system with proper URI scheme
   - Add notification system for dynamic updates

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Improve type safety in message handling
   - Add parameter validation following JSON Schema patterns
   - Implement proper logging system
   - Add telemetry and monitoring

## Questions to Resolve

1. How to handle persistent storage with proper security controls?
2. Best practices for scaling with multiple players and resource subscriptions?
3. How to handle client disconnects/reconnects with proper session management?
4. Strategy for handling real-time game state updates via notifications?
5. Best practices for error recovery following MCP specification patterns?
6. How to implement proper user consent flows for tool execution?
7. What testing strategies work best for MCP protocol compliance?
