## Recent Updates

### Specification Alignment (MCP 2025-03-26)
- ✅ Updated tool definitions with proper `inputSchema` and `annotations`
- ✅ Enhanced prompt structure with arguments and validation  
- ✅ Added comprehensive resource system documentation
- ✅ Improved security and trust configuration guidelines
- ✅ Added proper error handling patterns
- ✅ Updated notification patterns for dynamic updates
- ✅ Enhanced testing and validation guidelines

### Implementation Updates (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Updated `types/index.ts` with new Tool and Prompt interfaces aligned to MCP 2025-03-26
- ✅ Completely rebuilt `toolsService.ts` with proper tool/handler separation and new schema support
- ✅ Updated `promptsService.ts` to use new arguments-based Prompt interface
- ✅ Enhanced `stateService.ts` with missing helper methods
- ✅ Fixed all compilation errors in `mcp/server.ts` and integrated new service interfaces
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ **Implemented dynamic tool availability** - tools now appear/disappear based on game state
- ✅ **Added battle system** - players can fight monsters when present in rooms
- ✅ **Fixed item system** - added missing torch, key, potion, and gold item definitions
- ✅ **Enhanced state management** - proper TOOLS_CHANGED events emitted when game state changes
- ✅ **File cleanup** - removed duplicate `promptsService_new.ts` file

### Dynamic Tool System Features
- ✅ Tools are contextual based on current room state
- ✅ `take` tool only available when items are present in room
- ✅ `battle` tool only available when monsters are present in room  
- ✅ `move` tool only available when room has exits
- ✅ `look` and `inventory` tools always available
- ✅ TOOLS_CHANGED events emitted when:
  - Player moves between rooms
  - Items are taken from rooms
  - Monsters are defeated
  - Game state changes affect available actions

## Next Steps

1. **Testing & Validation**:
   - [ ] Test with MCP Inspector to validate protocol compliance
   - [ ] Verify all tool definitions include proper inputSchema
   - [ ] Test prompt system with new arguments structure
   - [ ] Validate error handling patterns
   - [ ] Test notification system for state changes

2. **Enhanced Features**:
   - [ ] Implement comprehensive resource system with proper URIs for game state access
   - [ ] Add resource subscription for real-time game state updates
   - [ ] Implement progress notifications for long-running actions
   - [ ] Add security controls and input validation
   - [ ] Enhanced tool annotations (destructiveHint, etc.)

3. **Game Features**:
   - [ ] More sophisticated battle system with proper tool annotations
   - [ ] Quest progression tracking with dynamic prompts
   - [ ] Save/load game state as resources
   - [ ] Multiple players support with proper security controls

4. **Security & Compliance**:
   - [ ] Implement user consent flows for tool execution
   - [ ] Add proper input validation for all tools and prompts
   - [ ] Implement access controls and data protection
   - [ ] Add audit logging for tool usage
   - [ ] Follow security best practices from specification

5. **Testing & Validation**:
   - [ ] Test with MCP Inspector tool
   - [ ] Add unit tests for all MCP protocol endpoints
   - [ ] Add integration tests with real MCP client
   - [ ] Validate against specification compliance checklist
   - [ ] Add automated build/test workflow

## Current Issues

1. ~~TypeScript build errors~~ (FIXED)
2. ~~Transport message handling~~ (FIXED)
3. ~~Specification alignment~~ (FIXED - Updated to 2025-03-26)
4. Need to update implementation to match new specification requirements
5. Need proper error recovery for failed requests
6. Need proper session cleanup on disconnects

## Technical Debt

1. **Specification Compliance**:
   - Update tool definitions to include `inputSchema` and `annotations`
   - Enhance prompt system with proper argument handling
   - Implement resource system with proper URI scheme
   - Add notification system for dynamic updates

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Improve type safety in message handling
   - Add parameter validation following JSON Schema patterns
   - Implement proper logging system
   - Add telemetry and monitoring

## Questions to Resolve

1. How to handle persistent storage with proper security controls?
2. Best practices for scaling with multiple players and resource subscriptions?
3. How to handle client disconnects/reconnects with proper session management?
4. Strategy for handling real-time game state updates via notifications?
5. Best practices for error recovery following MCP specification patterns?
6. How to implement proper user consent flows for tool execution?
7. What testing strategies work best for MCP protocol compliance?

## Implementation Priority
